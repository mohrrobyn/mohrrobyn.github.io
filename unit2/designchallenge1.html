<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?
	</h2>
		<p>The two websites I am most inspired by are <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a> and <a href="http://munchery.com">Munchery</a>.  Both use large photos as backgrounds that really catch your eye.
		</p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?
	</h2>
		<p>Both sites use large colorful images as the background of the page.  The negative space on the page is where many important links are found. The negative space helps direct the user's eye and gives the page balance.
		</p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?
	</h2>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a> page has a hero image that occupies the entire screen. There is very little white space and the emphasis is on a central image that showcases a SquareSpace design.  The <a href="http://munchery.com">Munchery</a> website, while also using a large hero image, has more white space which helps to draw the viewer's eye to the center of the page. Both sites are very clean, with similar typography.  The typography on both sites is black or neutral, allowing the colorful images to jump off the page.

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches & Process
	</h2>
	<p>	<strong>SquareSpace</strong></p>
		<img src="images/SquareSpacemockup.jpeg" height="275" width="415"><img src="images/SquareSpace Site.png" height="275" width="415">
			<p><li>The <strong>focal point</strong> of this site is the example of a SquareSpace site featured in the center of the page.</li>
			<li>The <strong>hierarchy</strong> and <strong>flow</strong> starts at the top with various navigation buttons, but your attention is grabbed by the large images that feature site designs. Instead of directing your eye from top to bottom, the site has a strong hero image where your eye is meant to travel from left to right.</li>
			<li>The <strong>balance</strong> on the SquareSpace site is centered, to focus your attention. The background, while busy allows a central image to standout.</li></p>
		<p><strong>Munchery</strong></p>
		<img src="images/Muncherymockup.jpeg" height="275" width="415"><img src="images/Munchery Site.png" height="275" width="415">
			<p><li>The <strong>focal point</strong> of this site is the text featured in the center of the page where it asks the viewer to input information.</li>
			<li>The <strong>hierarchy</strong> and <strong>focal point</strong> are easier to see.  The site uses more negative space and though it uses large images like SquareSpace, the site looks cleaner and simpler.</li>
			<li>The <strong>balance<strong> on Munchery is symmetrical as well but the whitespace on top puts more of an emphasis on navigation options. Unlike SquareSpace, the Munchery sites flow goes from top to bottom, guiding the viewer's eye down the page.</li></p>
